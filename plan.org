sushi swap plan

* Map WETH pools
1. finds logs from sushi swap
2. finds pools from PoolCreated event
3. if either token in the pool is WETH
   returns the pool
* Map WETH transfers
1. counts the amount of pools in the pools protobuf
2. if there is at least one pool
3. look at the calls
4. look at the callview
5. check if a my store pool has a transaction.from
6. if so populate protobuf
7. check if a my store pool has a transaction.to
8. if so populate protobug

* Store pools
Stores aggregates data as the substreams run. map modules run on each block
but the store will remember what it finds, unlike the maps that forget.
*

* Problems
- the problem is with line "if &format_hex(&callview.transaction.from) == pool_address"
  - either callview.transaction.from isn't good,
  - or pool_address is wrong
